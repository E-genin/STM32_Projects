- The project intends to implement a Register-Level Configuration of the Basic Timer 6 to be used as 1ms delay generator.

- The Mcu is clocked using PLL so that the Timer is Clocked with 8 MHz.

- The PLL itself is sourced from HSE for more accuracy. 

- The timer is used to toggle the LED1 on the Mcu each second.
